Git-Github text file will give me information about what
Test-Site is, and its shortcut commands, to give me some tips and tricks,
along with other files that shall be stored in it. 

Folder: test-site 
Contents: index.html, images, styles, scripts, git-github.txt, README.md

Scenario:

On Github: Add new repository "Create Project Name"
Clone the repository using the link HTTPS e.g. https://github.com/User/test-site.git > copy Http link URL

On Computer:
Commandline pwd > Create folder e.g. mkdir Websites (or test-site)
 -> cd Websites/ -> Clone repository (clone = copying) -> git clone (paste URL) example:
git clone https://github.com/bitsugar01/test-site.git test-site (note that Websites is the created
 directory, and in it, has test-site folder. Inside test-site will be tracked by .git)
-> add README.md file (you can create this in sublime) > add text on file >
 Create index.html file -> git status (anything red is untracked files)
Git & Github Command Prompts:

-git clone [http url] [Folder name]
-git status
-git add README.md or git add . 
-git commit -m "Insert Message"
-git push origin main/master (Origin = which branch; Master = Default code)
-git status -> cmd+R on github page / -git log -p
-add more changes to a file 
-git status (to see what files have changed)
-git add index.html
-git diff README.md (will show you changes you've done, untracked modified)
-git add .
-git commit -m "Second commit"
-git log (will show commit ID

You can go over other history of layers:
-git status 
-git diff README.md (note that it's untracked, modified: README.md)
-git checkout README.md
-git log

Git allows us to go back
-git checkout (ID)  (shows history)
-git checkout main/master (shows present)
